This sample is designed for use with the Intel® XDK.

Download the Intel® XDK at [xdk.intel.com](http://xdk.intel.com/).

This sample app illustrates the use of the Apache Cordova Media API, a
third-party low-latency audio plugin and the standard HTML5 `<audio>` tag. All
three APIs can be used to playback audio files on a device. The low-latency
plugin only supports iOS and Android devices.

Please read the [included tutorial](docs/README.m) for additional details.
